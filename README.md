Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological condition necessitating early detection for optimal management. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML), particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), offer promising avenues for PD diagnosis leveraging diverse data sources including speech recordings, clinical evaluations, and imaging studies. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of ML applications in PD diagnosis, with a particular focus on SVM. It delves into existing research to elucidate the efficacy and challenges of SVM-based techniques in this domain. Additionally, it presents and scrutinizes a novel SVM-driven approach for diagnosing PD through speech data analysis. By synthesizing existing literature and offering insights into the practical implementation of SVM models, this paper contributes to the burgeoning field of ML-enabled PD diagnosis, potentially facilitating early identification and intervention for individuals at risk of or afflicted by PD, thereby enhancing their quality of life.
